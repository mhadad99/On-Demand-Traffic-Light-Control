# On-Demand-Traffic-Light-Control
This system is an On-demand Traffic Light Control. It contains two traffic lights with six LEDs. One for cars and one for pedestrians. And also has a button for the pedestrian to push it when they cross the road. The system can detect when the button is pressed. Afterwards, based on the current state it would decide what to do.
